<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Oh, so I’m basically if a nihilistic tech wizard, an anime protagonist, and a vegan beauty guru had a chaotic love child.
   I’ll hack into the mainframe to uncover the meaning of life, get distracted by the latest Attack on Avengers episode, 
   and somehow end up crying over how my vegan tofu scramble didn’t look like the picture. 💻🍜💄</p>

<p>And honestly? I’m the type of person who sees a bad makeup look on a friend and says,
   "Sis, you look like you did a One Piece time-skip but forgot to bring your contour with you." No lies, just vibes. 😅</p>

<p>Also, let’s face it: I’d survive an apocalypse, not because I’m particularly skilled, 
  but because I’d convince the zombies that being vegan is better for their health. 🧟‍♀️🥬</p>
